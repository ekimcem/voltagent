  - Folded the serverless runtime entry point into the main build – importing `@voltagent/core` now auto-detects the runtime and provisions either the Node or serverless observability pipeline.
  - Rebuilt serverless observability on top of `BasicTracerProvider`, fetch-based OTLP exporters, and an execution-context `waitUntil` hook. Exports run with exponential backoff, never block the response, and automatically reuse VoltOps credentials (or fall back to the in-memory span/log store) so VoltOps Console transparently swaps to HTTP polling when WebSockets are unavailable.
  - Hardened the runtime utilities for Workers/Functions: added universal `randomUUID`, base64, and event-emitter helpers, and taught the default logger to emit OpenTelemetry logs without relying on Node globals. This removes the last Node-only dependencies from the serverless bundle.

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { serverlessHono } from "@voltagent/serverless-hono";
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

  import { weatherTool } from "./tools";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "serverless-assistant",
    instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  });

  const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    serverless: serverlessHono(),
  });

  export default voltAgent.serverless().toCloudflareWorker();
  ```

  ## @voltagent/serverless-hono
  - Renamed the edge provider to **serverless** and upgraded it to power any fetch-based runtime (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, Deno Deploy, Netlify Functions).
  - Wrapped the Cloudflare adapter in a first-class `HonoServerlessProvider` that installs a scoped `waitUntil` bridge, reuses the shared routing layer, and exposes a `/ws` health stub so VoltOps Console can cleanly fall back to polling.
  - Dropped the manual environment merge – Workers should now enable the `nodejs_compat_populate_process_env` flag (documented in the new deployment guide) instead of calling `mergeProcessEnv` themselves.

  ## @voltagent/server-core
  - Reworked the observability handlers around the shared storage API, including a new `POST /setup-observability` helper that writes VoltOps keys into `.env` and expanded trace/log queries that match the serverless storage contract.

  ## @voltagent/cli
  - Added `volt deploy --target <cloudflare|vercel|netlify>` to scaffold the right config files. The Cloudflare template now ships with the required compatibility flags (`nodejs_compat`, `nodejs_compat_populate_process_env`, `no_handle_cross_request_promise_resolution`) so new projects run on Workers without extra tweaking.

### Patch Changes

- [#596](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/596) [`355836b`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/355836b39a6d1ba36c5cfac82008cab3281703e7) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - - add `@voltagent/a2a-server`, a JSON-RPC Agent-to-Agent (A2A) server that lets external agents call your VoltAgent instance over HTTP/SSE
  - teach `@voltagent/core`, `@voltagent/server-core`, and `@voltagent/server-hono` to auto-register configured A2A servers so adding `{ a2aServers: { ... } }` on `VoltAgent` and opting into `honoServer` instantly exposes discovery and RPC endpoints
  - forward request context (`userId`, `sessionId`, metadata) into agent invocations and provide task management hooks, plus allow filtering/augmenting exposed agents by default
  - document the setup in `website/docs/agents/a2a/a2a-server.md` and refresh `examples/with-a2a-server` with basic usage and task-store customization
  - A2A endpoints are now described in Swagger/OpenAPI and listed in the startup banner whenever an A2A server is registered, making discovery of `/.well-known/...` and `/a2a/:serverId` routes trivial.

  **Getting started**

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { A2AServer } from "@voltagent/a2a-server";
  import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "SupportAgent",
    purpose: "Handle support questions from partner agents.",
    model: myModel,
  });

  const a2aServer = new A2AServer({
    name: "support-agent",
    version: "0.1.0",
  });

  export const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    a2aServers: { a2aServer },
    server: honoServer({ port: 3141 }),
  });
  ```

  We shipped a complete MCP integration stack:
  - `@voltagent/mcp-server` exposes VoltAgent registries (agents, workflows, tools) over stdio/HTTP/SSE transports.
  - `@voltagent/server-core` and `@voltagent/server-hono` gained ready-made route handlers so HTTP servers can proxy MCP traffic with a few lines of glue code.
  - `@voltagent/core` exports the shared types that the MCP layers rely on.

  ### Quick start

  ```ts title="src/mcp/server.ts"
  import { MCPServer } from "@voltagent/mcp-server";
  import { Agent, createTool } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
  import { z } from "zod";

  const status = createTool({
    name: "status",
    description: "Return the current time",
    parameters: z.object({}),
    async execute() {
      return { status: "ok", time: new Date().toISOString() };
    },
  });

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "Support Agent",
    instructions: "Route customer tickets to the correct queue.",
    model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools: [status],
  });

  export const mcpServer = new MCPServer({
    name: "voltagent-example",
    version: "0.1.0",
    description: "Expose VoltAgent over MCP",
    agents: { support: assistant },
    tools: { status },
    filterTools: ({ items }) => items.filter((tool) => tool.name !== "debug"),
  });
  ```

  With the server registered on your VoltAgent instance (and the Hono MCP routes enabled), the same agents, workflows, and tools become discoverable from VoltOps Console or any MCP-compatible IDE.

- [#596](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/pull/596) [`355836b`](https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent/commit/355836b39a6d1ba36c5cfac82008cab3281703e7) Thanks [@omeraplak](https://github.com/omeraplak)! - - Ship `@voltagent/mcp-server`, a transport-agnostic MCP provider that surfaces VoltAgent agents, workflows, tools, prompts, and resources over stdio, SSE, and HTTP.
  - Wire MCP registration through `@voltagent/core`, `@voltagent/server-core`, and `@voltagent/server-hono` so a single `VoltAgent` constructor opt-in (optionally with `honoServer`) exposes stdio mode immediately and HTTP/SSE endpoints when desired.
  - Filter child sub-agents automatically and lift an agent's `purpose` (fallback to `instructions`) into the MCP tool description for cleaner IDE listings out of the box.
  - Document the workflow in `website/docs/agents/mcp/mcp-server.md` and refresh `examples/with-mcp-server` with stdio-only and HTTP/SSE configurations.
  - When MCP is enabled we now publish REST endpoints in Swagger/OpenAPI and echo them in the startup banner so you can discover `/mcp/*` routes without digging through code.

  **Getting started**

  ```ts
  import { Agent, VoltAgent } from "@voltagent/core";
  import { MCPServer } from "@voltagent/mcp-server";
  import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";

  const assistant = new Agent({
    name: "AssistantAgent",
    purpose: "Respond to support questions and invoke helper tools when needed.",
    model: myModel,
  });

  const mcpServer = new MCPServer({
    name: "support-mcp",
    version: "1.0.0",
    agents: { assistant },
    protocols: { stdio: true, http: false, sse: false },
  });

  export const voltAgent = new VoltAgent({
    agents: { assistant },
    mcpServers: { primary: mcpServer },
    server: honoServer({ port: 3141 }), // flip http/sse to true when you need remote clients
  });
  ```

  The /agents/:id/chat endpoint was missing from PROTECTED_ROUTES, causing it to bypass JWT authentication while other execution endpoints (/text, /stream, /object, /stream-object) correctly required authentication.

  This fix ensures all agent execution endpoints consistently require JWT authentication when jwtAuth is configured.

  What’s new
  - Core + server now support `zod` v4 while keeping v3 working.
  - Peer ranges expanded to `"zod": "^3.25.0 || ^4.0.0"`.
  - JSON Schema → Zod conversion handles both versions:
    - Uses `zod-from-json-schema@^0.5.0` when Zod v4 is detected.
    - Falls back to `zod-from-json-schema@^0.0.5` via alias `zod-from-json-schema-v3` for Zod v3.
  - Implemented in MCP client (core) and object handlers (server-core).

  Why
  - Zod v4 introduces changes that require a version-aware conversion path. This update adds seamless compatibility for both major versions.

  Impact
  - No breaking changes. Projects on Zod v3 continue to work unchanged. Projects can upgrade to Zod v4 without code changes.

  Notes
  - If your bundler disallows npm aliasing, ensure it can resolve `zod-from-json-schema-v3` (alias to `zod-from-json-schema@^0.0.5`).

  Server endpoints now accept ModelMessage format (messages with `role` and `content` fields) in addition to UIMessage format and plain strings. This allows clients to send messages in either format:
  - **String**: Direct text input
  - **UIMessage[]**: AI SDK UIMessage format with `parts` structure
  - **ModelMessage[]**: AI SDK ModelMessage format with `role` and `content` structure

  The change adopts a flexible validation, where the server handlers pass input directly to agents which handle the conversion. API schemas and documentation have been updated to reflect this support.

  Example:

  ```typescript
  // All three formats are now supported
  await fetch("/agents/assistant/text", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      // Option 1: String
      input: "Hello",

      // Option 2: UIMessage format
      input: [{ role: "user", parts: [{ type: "text", text: "Hello" }] }],

      // Option 3: ModelMessage format

  Fixed a critical issue where users would encounter "EADDRINUSE: address already in use" errors when starting VoltAgent servers. The problem was caused by a race condition in the port availability check where the test server wasn't fully closed before the actual server tried to bind to the same port.

  ## What was happening

  When checking if a port was available, the port manager would:
  1. Create a test server and bind to the port
  2. On successful binding, immediately close the server
  3. Return `true` indicating the port was available
  4. But the test server wasn't fully closed yet when `serve()` tried to bind to the same port

  ## The fix

  Modified the port availability check in `port-manager.ts` to:
  - Wait for the server's close callback before returning
  - Add a small delay (50ms) to ensure the OS has fully released the port
  - This prevents the race condition between test server closure and actual server startup

  ## Changes
  - **port-manager.ts**: Fixed race condition by properly waiting for test server to close
  - **hono-server-provider.ts**: Added proper error handling for server startup failures

  This ensures reliable server startup without port conflicts.

  We aligned Zod versions across packages to `^3.25.76` to match AI SDK peer ranges and avoid multiple Zod instances at runtime.

  Why this matters
  - Fixes TypeScript narrowing issues in workflows when consuming `@voltagent/core` from npm with a different Zod instance (e.g., `ai` packages pulling newer Zod).
  - Prevents errors like "Spread types may only be created from object types" where `data` failed to narrow because `z.ZodTypeAny` checks saw different Zod identities.

  What changed
  - `@voltagent/server-core`, `@voltagent/server-hono`: dependencies.zod → `^3.25.76`.
  - `@voltagent/docs-mcp`, `@voltagent/core`: devDependencies.zod → `^3.25.76`.
  - Examples and templates updated to use `^3.25.76` for consistency (non-publishable).

  Notes for consumers
  - Ensure a single Zod version is installed (consider a workspace override to pin Zod to `3.25.76`).
  - This improves compatibility with `ai@5.x` packages that require `zod@^3.25.76 || ^4`.
